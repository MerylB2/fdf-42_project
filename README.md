# fdf-42_project
FdF is a project in which we convert a file with a grid of height values into a 3d wireframe using a simple graphics library called MiniLibX.The goal of this project is to introduce you to graphics, and especially rendering and transformations, basically we are given a map as a file. We have to transform that map into a 2d graphical representation
